# Kubed: A Kotlin DSL for data visualization

Kubed is a data visualization DSL embedded within the Kotlin programming language. It enables the manipulation of the JavaFX scenegraph based on data.

Kubed is *heavily* inspired by [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), and supports many of the features found in D3: selections, transitions, scales, colorspaces, easing, and interpolators. Additionally features are coming soon.

This is an experimental API and is subject to breaking changes until a first major release,
